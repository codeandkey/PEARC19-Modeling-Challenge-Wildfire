DISPLAY = False
SHOW_STATS = False <-- Can be set to true if you like, but the recommended setting is False.
TREE_COUNT_X = 40
TREE_COUNT_Y = 40
BURN_CHANCE = 85
FOREST_DENSITY = 80
NUM_FIRES = 4  <-- Set to 4 instead of 1 when graphing, this increases run speed and prevents initial fires from sputtering out. Helps to make the data more consistant.
WIND_SPEED = 0 <-- Wind Speed is the least precise variable. Set to 0 to eliminate noise when graphing sensitivity of the other variables.
